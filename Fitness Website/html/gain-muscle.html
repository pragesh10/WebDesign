      <h2>Approach to Gaining Muscle</h2>

      <p><strong>1. Caloric Surplus</strong><br>
      It is a concept where you eat more calories than you burn, putting your body in a caloric surplus. If you do this consistently the right way, you will gain muscle with minimal fat gain. You can't force-feed your muscles, and building muscle takes time. If you gain weight fast, then the majority of it will be fat rather than muscle, which will make you more fat and you will need to invest extra time into cutting away those unwanted fat. You should aim to gain 1–2% of your body weight per month.
      </p>

      <p><strong>2. Nutrition</strong><br>
      To fuel your body and to build enough muscle, you will need to eat about 1.6 – 2.2 grams of protein per kg of your body weight. 20–30% of your total calories should come from fats, and the remaining calories should come from carbs to give you enough energy.
      </p>

      <p><strong>3. Training</strong><br>
      For a beginner to start things slowly and effectively, we need to build the habit of exercising. So for the first 2 to 3 weeks, what I would recommend is to do only one exercise of 3 sets each for every muscle group from head to toe in a day. You can do this 3 to 4 times a week depending on how sore you feel.
      </p>

      <p>
      After that, you can switch to a Push-Pull-Leg split and alternate with Upper Lower split, which is the most optimal split for beginners, intermediates, or even pros to gain muscle mass.
