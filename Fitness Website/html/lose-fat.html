      <h2>Approach to Fat Loss</h2>
      <p>
        Fat loss is less complicated then you ever assumed. As someone who has struggled years with weight, I know it gets frustrating when you feel hungry all the time yet don't see any weight go down. So let's first understand the science behind weight loss to keep things fair and simple: 
      </p>

      <p><strong>1. Caloric Deficit</strong><br>
      Fat loss occurs because of caloric deficit which means you are eating less calorie than you are burning. Now what does burning calories even mean? Bare with me for a second to understand this concept.</p>

      <p>There are 4 ways you and I burn calories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>i. Resting Energy Expenditure</strong><br>
        This is nothing but the number of calories your body burns just for existing and making every organ function properly.</li>

        <li><strong>ii. Exercise</strong><br>
        This is the number of calories you burn from exercising.</li>

        <li><strong>iii. Non-Exercise Activity</strong><br>
        This is all the activity which is not exercise like sitting down, shaking your leg etc.</li>

        <li><strong>iv. Food</strong><br>
        Yes, the food which you have a love-hate relationship with burns some extra calories just so it can be digested properly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        So in simple words, you just need to eat foods that total to less calorie than you burn throughout the day. For example: If you burn 2500 calories a day and you eat about 2000, then you will be in a caloric deficit. If you run this 500 calorie deficit for a week then you will lose about 0.45 kg or 1 lb which is what you should aim for in order to sustain the weight loss journey once and for all.
      </p>
      <p><strong>2. Weight Training</strong><br>
Why is weight training important you may ask? To build muscle you must weight train. If you just focus on losing fat without caring about anything else, then you will most likely end up looking skinny which can again make you less confident. So to balance your looks and live a healthy life, you should also focus on building muscle along with losing fat.
</p>

<p>
For a beginner to start things slowly and effectively, we need to build the habit of exercising. So for the first 2 to 3 weeks, what I would recommend is to do only one exercise of 3 sets each for every muscle group from head to toe in a day. You can do this 3 to 4 times a week depending on how sore you feel.
</p>

<p>
After that, you can switch to a Push-Pull-Leg split, which is the most optimal split for beginners, intermediates or even pros to gain muscle mass.
</p>

<p><strong>3. Protein</strong><br>
Now, to fuel your body you will need to eat enough protein so that you will start to build muscle. Protein is something that takes a lot of time to break down or digest, hence making you less hungry — which will ease this weight loss journey. Protein intake recommendation for an average gym goer would be around 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kg of your body weight.
<br><br>
Example: If you weigh 70 kg then 70 * 1.6 or @ 2.2 = 112 / 154 grams of protein.
</p>

<p>
Now, that may sound like a lot of protein to eat, but as a very beginner you can eat less than this. Just make sure to increase as you progress and try to hit your daily protein goal.
</p>

<p>
As per which type of food and recipes to follow — you can eat whatever food gives comfort to you. The only thing you need to make sure of is to stay within your daily calorie intake and hit your protein goal.
